# Euterpe: Neurofeedback with Muse Headband

## IMPORTANT: 
If the Muse is not appearing even if you have turned on the Close Devices Settings, try going to the Device's Settings and turning on all non-allowed Permissions. We included this on the code but it has been happening nevertheless.

## Purpose

Create an application that measures the user's level of relaxation using Muse EEG data and provides pleasant visual feedback. The goal is to help the user relax and promote mental well-being.

##  Description

This project focuses on addressing real mental health issues by utilizing Muse EEG data to assess the user's relaxation level. The application will process EEG signals to calculate a relaxation index and present visually appealing feedback to guide the user toward a state of relaxation.

##  Requirements

1. **Read EEG from Muse**
   - Utilize all 4 channels of Muse EEG for data acquisition.

2. **Calculate Relaxation Level**
   - Perform signal processing on EEG data, particularly focusing on frequencies, to calculate a relaxation index.

3. **User Interface Design**
   - Create an appealing and simple user interface.
   - Implement a design that dynamically adjusts in size based on the user's level of relaxation.
   - Include a pulsating design to guide the user in achieving the necessary breathing rhythm for relaxation.

4. **Completion Feedback**
   - When the user reaches a completely relaxed state, end the activity and display a message indicating "Achieved Relaxation."

5. **Record Keeping**
   - Maintain records of each usage, including:
      - Graphical representation of relaxation scores over each session.
      - Statistics on the time taken to achieve complete relaxation.

6. **Profile Graph**
   - Provide a graph displaying the time taken to relax on days when the application is used.

##  Development

This project will be developed using this Github repository and also a RedMine interface for Agile Project Management. Please refer to both for a more complete view of the project and development.
